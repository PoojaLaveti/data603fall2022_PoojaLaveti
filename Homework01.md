## Big Data with examples and types
The term itself explains what Big Data is as Big which means something that is huge and data which means information, combinely big data means huge information. So big data contains that huge amount information that it becomes difficult to process it. As the world is running with data, storing data is very important and using the stored information wisely is more important. Processing the Big data takes the steps like collecting the data from different places, storing the data in an organized manner, using the necessary data when needed, gaining insights from the data for bussiness purposes. In order to process the data different kinds of tools and techniques are used.  
There are so many examples of big data as it is everywhere in our daily lifes. The amount of information that is generated by social networks in the form of images, large videos and texts. Data generated by healthcare organizations, commercial websites, banking aplications and many others.
Big data is of three diffrent types
### Structured Data
Structured data is an organized data, that is easy to access, read and manipulate. For example employee details in a company like their personal details, job specifications, salaries and others are stored in a structured format.
### Unstructured Data
Structured data is an unorganized data, that is difficult to access, read and manipulate. It takes lot of time and effort to gain insights from an unstructured data. Email is an example of unstructured data,containing spam mails that are difficult to sperate from original ones.
### Semi Structured Data
Semi Structured data is combination of both structured and unstructured. It contains data that is important but unorganized mostly.
## 6 V's of Big Data
### Volume
As described the volume of the big data is so huge and it takes lot of effort to process and gain insights from the data. It takes multiple machines, tools and techniques to store and use it when needed.
### Velocity
As the term velocity relates to speed, data that is generated with speed like real time data should be able to get updated to the old data effectively. So that the data is up to date with new information stored.
### Variety
There are wide variety of data that are structured, unstructured and semi structured that includes texts, audio, video, image, sensors forms of data.
### Variability
Variability refers to the inconsitency, that is the way the data gets changed from time to time. Stock market data changes all the time it is never fixed or consistent.
### Veracity
Veracity refers to the accuracy and quality of the data. It is necessary for the data to be maintained with relevant information so that gaining insights from the data will be achieved accurately.
### value
Data has immensive value as we gain useful information from it. Everyones intention for storing large amount of data is to gain something valuable from it.
