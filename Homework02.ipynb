      "     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a  substitute? I wonder . . . perhaps the task of nursing  me has become wearisome for you, “Wormtail? Could  this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing  more than an attempt to desert me?”   “My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all     “Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice. “I can  always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever  returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you  look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me. ...”   “No! My devotion to Your Lordship — ”   “Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You  would not be here if you had anywhere else to go.   How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding  every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?”   “But you seem so much stronger, My Lord — ”   “Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger,  and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of  the little health I have regained under your clumsy  care. Silencel”   Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell  silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear  nothing but the fire crackling. Then the second man  spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.   “I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have  already explained to you, and I will use no other. I  have waited thirteen years. A few more months will  make no difference. As for the protection surrounding  the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is  needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail —   Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full  extent of Lord Voldemort’s wrath — ”   “My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his  voice now. “All through our journey I have gone over  the plan in my head — My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s  disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if  we proceed, if I murder — ”   “IP” whispered the second voice. “If? If you follow the  plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that  anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and  without fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but  in my present condition ... Come, Wormtail, one more  death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not  asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful  servant will have rejoined us — ”   “I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest  trace of sullenness in his voice.   “Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody  whose loyalty has never wavered, and you,  unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.”   “I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely  a sulky edge to his voice now. “I was the one who  found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.”   “That is true,” said the second man, sounding  amused. “A stroke of brilliance I would not have  thought possible from you, Wormtail — though, if  truth be told, you were not aware how useful she  would be when you caught her, were you?”   “I — I thought she might be useful, My Lord — ”   “Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel  amusement more pronounced than ever. “However, I   Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      do not deny that her information was invaluable.  Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and  for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will  allow you to perform an essential task for me, one  that many of my followers would give their right  hands to perform. ...”   “R-really, My Lord? What — ?” Wormtail sounded  terrified again.   “Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the  surprise? Your part will come at the very end ... but I  promise you, you will have the honor of being just as  useful as Bertha Jorkins.”   “You ... you ...” Wormtail’s voice suddenly sounded  hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. “You  . . . are going ... to kill me too?”   “Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why  would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She  was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite  useless. In any case, awkward questions would have  been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with  the news that she had met you on her holidays.  Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well  not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside  inns. ...”   Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank  could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh  — an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.   “We could have modified her memory? But Memory  Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I  proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to  her memory not to use the information I extracted  from her, Wormtail.”     Page | 13     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware  that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery  with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a  woman. He was talking about it without any kind of  remorse — with amusement. He was dangerous — a  madman. And he was planning more murders — this  boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was — was in danger —   Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the  time to go to the police. He would creep out of the  house and head straight for the telephone box in the  village . . . but the cold voice was speaking again, and  Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot,  listening with all his might.   “One more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts  ... Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is  decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet ...  I think I hear Nagini. ...”   And the second man’s voice changed. He started  making noises such as Frank had never heard before;  he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath.  Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or  seizure.   And then Frank heard movement behind him in the  dark passageway. He turned to look, and found  himself paralyzed with fright.   Something was slithering toward him along the dark  corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of  firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a  gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified,  transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a  wide, curving track through the thick dust on the  floor, coming closer and closer — What was he to do?  The only means of escape was into the room where     Page | 14     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where  he was the snake would surely kill him —   But before he had made his decision, the snake was  level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it  was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing  noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in  seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had  vanished through the gap.   There was sweat on Frank’s forehead now, and the  hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the  room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and  Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible  idea. . . . This man could talk to snakes.   Frank didn’t understand what was going on. He  wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with  his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs  didn’t seem to want to move. As he stood there  shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice  switched abruptly to English again.   “Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said.   “In-indeed, My Lord?” said Wormtail.   “Indeed, yes,” said the voice. “According to Nagini,  there is an old Muggle standing right outside this  room, listening to every word we say.”   Frank didn’t have a chance to hide himself. There  were footsteps, and then the door of the room was  flung wide open.   A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed  nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a  mixture of fear and alarm in his face.     Page | 15     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your  manners?”   The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair  before the fire, but Frank couldn’t see the speaker.  The snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the  rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet  dog.   Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still  deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his  walking stick and limped over the threshold.   The fire was the only source of light in the room; it  cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank  stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it  seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank  couldn’t even see the back of his head.   “You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.   “What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly,  for now that he was inside the room, now that the  time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver;  it had always been so in the war.   “I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly. “It  means that you are not a wizard.”   “I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank,  his voice growing steadier. “All I know is I’ve heard  enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You’ve  done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell  you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration, “my  wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back — ”   “You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly.  “Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that     Page | 16     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort,  Muggle, for he knows ... he always knows. ...”   “Is that right?” said Frank roughly. “Lord, is it? Well, I  don’t think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn  ’round and face me like a man, why don’t you?”   “But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice,  barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. “I  am much, much more than a man. However ... why  not? I will face you. ... Wormtail, come turn my chair  around.”   The servant gave a whimper.   “You heard me, Wormtail.”   Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would  rather have done anything than approach his master  and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small  man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The  snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed  slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.   And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw  what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the  floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out  a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never  heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it  raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a  rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was  dead before he hit the floor.   Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter  woke with a start.     Page | 17     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling        THE SCAR   Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though  he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid  dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old  scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of  lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though  someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his  skin.   He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other  reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which  were on the bedside table. He put them on and his  bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty  orange light that was filtering through the curtains  from the street lamp outside the window.   Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still  painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled  out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe,  and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A  skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright  green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He     Page | 18     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling     examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more  closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.   Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming  about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real. ...  There had been two people he knew and one he  didn’t. ... He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to  remember. ...   The dim picture of a darkened room came to him. ...  There had been a snake on a hearth rug ... a small  man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail ... and a cold,  high voice ... the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt  as though an ice cube had slipped down into his  stomach at the very thought. ...   He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what  Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible. ...  All Harry knew was that at the moment when  Voldemort’s chair had swung around, and he, Harry,  had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of  horror, which had awoken him ... or had that been  the pain in his scar?   And who had the old man been? For there had  definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him  fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused.   Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his  bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly  lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his  cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as  fast as he tried to hold on to them. ... Voldemort and  Wormtail had been talking about someone they had  killed, though Harry could not remember the name . . .  and they had been plotting to kill someone else . . .  him).   Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes,  and stared around his bedroom as though expecting   Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      to see something unusual there. As it happened,  there were an extraordinary number of unusual  things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open  at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron,  broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks.  Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that  was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which  his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor  beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been  reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures  in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange  robes were zooming in and out of sight on  broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.   Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and  watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal  by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop.   Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch — in  Harry’s opinion, the best sport in the world —  couldn’t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying  with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the  window, and drew back the curtains to survey the  street below.   Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban  street would be expected to look in the early hours of  Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far  as Harry could see through the darkness, there  wasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.   And yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to  the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his  scar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered him;   Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost  all the bones from his right arm once and had them  painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been  pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long  afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet  from an airborne broomstick. He was used to bizarre  \n"

      " Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      a word he’s saying. Barty’ll be able to sort it out. He  speaks about a hundred and fifty languages.”   “Mr. Crouch?” said Percy, suddenly abandoning his  look of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing  with excitement. “He speaks over two hundred!  Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ...”   “Anyone can speak Troll,” said Fred dismissively. “All  you have to do is point and grunt.”   Percy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked  the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil.   “Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?” Mr. Weasley  asked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass  beside them all.   “Not a dicky bird,” said Bagman comfortably. “But  she’ll turn up. Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky  cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you take my  word for it. She’ll wander back into the office  sometime in October, thinking it’s still July.”   “You don’t think it might be time to send someone to  look for her?” Mr. Weasley suggested tentatively as  Percy handed Bagman his tea.   “Barty Crouch keeps saying that,” said Bagman, his  round eyes widening innocently, “but we really can’t  spare anyone at the moment. Oh — talk of the devil!  Barty!”   A wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he  could not have made more of a contrast with Ludo  Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp  robes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man,  dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The  parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally  Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire -J.K. Rowling      straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked  as though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His shoes  were very highly polished. Harry could see at once  why Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in  rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied  with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly  that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry  doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him  for what he really was.   “Pull up a bit of grass, Barty,” said Ludo brightly,  patting the ground beside him.   “No thank you, Ludo,” said Crouch, and there was a  bite of impatience in his voice. “I’ve been looking for  you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add  another twelve seats to the Top Box.”   “Oh is that what they’re after?” said Bagman. “I  thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of  tweezers. Bit of a strong accent.”   “Mr. Crouch!” said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a  kind of half-bow that made him look like a  hunchback. “Would you like a cup of tea?”   “Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild  surprise. “Yes — thank you, Weatherby.”   Fred and George choked into their own cups. Percy,  very pink around the ears, busied himself with the  kettle.   “Oh and I’ve been wanting a word with you too,  Arthur,” said Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon  Mr. Weasley. “Ali Bashir’s on the warpath. He wants a  word with you about your embargo on flying carpets.”   Mr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.   Page | 100 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I’ve  told him once I’ve told him a hundred times: Carpets  are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of  Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?”   “I doubt it,” said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from  Percy. “He’s desperate to export here.”   “Well, they’ll never replace brooms in Britain, will  they?” said Bagman.   “Ali thinks there’s a niche in the market for a family  vehicle,” said Mr. Crouch. “I remember my  grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve  — but that was before carpets were banned, of  course.”   He spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any  doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the  law.   “So, been keeping busy, Barty?” said Bagman  breezily.   “Fairly,” said Mr. Crouch dryly. “Organizing Portkeys  across five continents is no mean feat, Ludo.”   “I expect you’ll both be glad when this is over?” said  Mr. Weasley.   Ludo Bagman looked shocked.   “Glad! Don’t know when I’ve had more fun. ... Still,  it’s not as though we haven’t got anything to look  forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize, eh?”   Mr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.     Page | 101     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “We agreed not to make the announcement until all  the details — ”   “Oh details!” said Bagman, waving the word away like  a cloud of midges. “They’ve signed, haven’t they?  They’ve agreed, haven’t they? I bet you anything these  kids’ll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it’s  happening at Hogwarts — ”   “Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know,”  said Mr. Crouch sharply, cutting Bagman’s remarks  short. “Thank you for the tea, Weatherby.”   He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited  for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet,  swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his  pockets chinking merrily.   “See you all later!” he said. “You’ll be up in the Top  Box with me — I’m commentating!” He waved, Barty  Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them  Disapparated.   “What’s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?” said Fred at  once. “What were they talking about?”   “You’ll find out soon enough,” said Mr.Weasley,  smiling.   “It’s classified information, until such time as the  Ministry decides to release it,” said Percy stiffly. “Mr.  Crouch was quite right not to disclose it.”   “Oh shut up, Weatherby,” said Fred.   A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over  the campsite as the afternoon wore on. By dusk, the  still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with  anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain   Page | 102 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last  vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed  to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting  the signs of blatant magic now breaking out  everywhere.   Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying  trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary  merchandise. There were luminous rosettes — green  for Ireland, red for Bulgaria — which were squealing  the names of the players, pointed green hats  bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves  adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both  countries that played their national anthems as they  were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that  really flew, and collectible figures of famous players,  which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening  themselves.   “Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,”  Ron told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through  the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron  purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green  rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum,  the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked  backward and forward over Ron’s hand, scowling up  at the green rosette above him.   “Wow, look at these!” said Harry, hurrying over to a  cart piled high with what looked like brass  binoculars, except that they were covered with all  sorts of weird knobs and dials.   “Omnioculars,” said the saleswizard eagerly. “You can  replay action . . . slow everything down . . . and they  flash up a play-by-play breakdown if you need it.  Bargain — ten Galleons each.”     Page | 103     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Wish I hadn’t bought this now,” said Ron, gesturing  at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at  the Omnioculars.   “Three pairs,” said Harry firmly to the wizard.   “No — don’t bother,” said Ron, going red. He was  always touchy about the fact that Harry, who had  inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much  more money than he did.   “You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” Harry  told him, thrusting Omnioculars into his and  Hermione’s hands. “For about ten years, mind.”   “Fair enough,” said Ron, grinning.   “Oooh, thanks, Harry,” said Hermione. “And I’ll get us  some programs, look — ”   Their money bags considerably lighter, they went  back to the tents. Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were all  sporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was  carrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no  souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold.   And then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere  beyond the woods, and at once, green and red  lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to  the field.   “It’s time!” said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any  of them. “Come on, let’s go!”     Page | 104     Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling       -4     THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP   Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead,  they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-  lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of  people moving around them, shouts and laughter,  snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish  excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn’t stop  grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty  minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they  emerged on the other side and found themselves in  the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry  could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls  surrounding the field, he could tell that ten  cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.   “Seats a hundred thousand,” said Mr. Weasley,  spotting the awestruck look on Harry’s face. “Ministry  task force of five hundred have been working on it all  year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it.  Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all  year, they’ve suddenly remembered urgent  appointments and had to dash away again . . . bless  them,” he added fondly, leading the way toward the  Page | 105 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a  swarm of shouting witches and wizards.   “Prime seats!” said the Ministry witch at the entrance  when she checked their tickets. “Top Box! Straight  upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.”   The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich  purple. They clambered upward with the rest of the  crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into  the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley’s party  kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the  staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at  the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly  halfway between the golden goal posts. About twenty  purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and  Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys,  looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could  never have imagined.   A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking  their places in the seats, which rose in levels around  the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a  mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from  the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet  from their lofty position. At either end of the field  stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite  them, almost at Harry’s eye level, was a gigantic  blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as  though an invisible giant’s hand were scrawling upon  the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching  it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements  across the field.   The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — safe,  reliable, and with Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer ... Mrs.  Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain,  No Stain! ... Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris,  Hogsmeade ...   Page | 106 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked  over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box  with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny  creature sitting in the second from last seat at the  end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs  were so short they stuck out in front of it on the  chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and  it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long,  batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . .   “ Dobby ?” said Harry incredulously.   The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers,  revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact  size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn’t Dobby — it  was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry’s  friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free  from his old owners, the Malfoy family.   “Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf  curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was  higher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny,  quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected —  though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf — that  this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione  spun around in their seats to look. Though they had  heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never  actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in  interest.   “Sorry,” Harry told the elf, “I just thought you were  someone I knew.”   “But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She  was shielding her face, as though blinded by light,  though the Top Box was not brightly lit. “My name is  Winky, sir — and you, sir — ” Her dark brown eyes  widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon  Harry’s scar. “You is surely Harry Potter!”   Page | 107 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling      “Yeah, I am,” said Harry.     “But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said,  lowering her hands very slightly and looking  awestruck.   “How is he?” said Harry. “How’s freedom suiting  him?”   “Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head, “ah sir,  meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did  Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.”   “Why?” said Harry, taken aback. “What’s wrong with  him?”   “Freedom is going to Dobby’s head, sir,” said Winky  sadly. “Ideas above his station, sir. Can’t get another  position, sir.”   “Why not?” said Harry.   Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and  whispered, “He is wanting paying for his work, sir.”   “Paying?” said Harry blankly. “Well — why shouldn’t  he be paid?”   Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed  her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden  again.   “House-elves is not paid, sir!” she said in a muffled  squeak. “No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find  yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is  getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is  unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing  around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear  you’s up in front of the Department for the Regulation  \n"
